## Welcome!!

👋 Hi, I’m @rsradulescu and I´m from Argentina, Patagonia Argentina! Beautiful place 😍

### I love data ❤️! 

I have a degree in computer science and then I was studying a master's degree in big data at the University of Valencia - VIU (thanks to a scholarship from IDEO Latam).
I work as a database teacher at the University of Patagonia and in 2020 I started working with cloud developments, both AWS and Azure, as a Data engineer.
I enjoy learning day by day, finding challenges in my work and being able to apply and teach what I learn.

Here you will find a small sample of what I have done in these years. Enjoy 😎
