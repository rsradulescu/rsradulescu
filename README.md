## Welcome!!

👋 Hi, I’m @rsradulescu and I´m from Argentina, Patagonia Argentina! Beautiful place 😍

### I love data ❤️! 

I have a degree in Computer Science and a Master's degree in Big Data from the University of Valencia - VIU (thanks to a scholarship from IDEO Latam).
I worked as database professor at the University of Patagonia and since 2020 I have been working with cloud developments, both AWS and Azure, as a Data Engineer.
I enjoy learning every day, finding challenges in my work and being able to apply and teach what I learn.

Here you will find a small sample of what I have done in these years. Enjoy 😎
